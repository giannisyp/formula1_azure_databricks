# formula1_azure_databricks
# This is a project that uses azure databricks to do analysis on formula1 drivers results and teams 

1. In this project we ingest data from ergast-api (https://ergast.com/mrd/) that documents all races from formula1 since 1950

2. we transform the data using databricks notebooks to make the data ready for presentation 

3.  finally we present datasets with race results , driver standings , team standings , etc ...

4. Also a couple of visualizations are made in the databricks notebooks of the dominant drivers and teams for a better understanding of the subjects that we explore.
